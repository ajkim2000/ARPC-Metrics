Unfortunately, nothing we can really do for that while you are teleworking. If you bring the laptop in, we can connect to the WiFi in our office and see how the VPN is running. 

I would also suggest switching servers in the JRSS VPN client to see if that resolves your connectivity problems.

Subject: Purge folder deleted

Good afternoon Purge Team members, 


It was brought to our attention that the AFRCDAR folder under the O: drive was deleted. That means the database and all archived documents have been lost. Unfortunately this will take some time to rebuild and you will need to re-accomplish the comments for the lines that have been corrected. If anyone has an archive of the report that would be helpful. I apologize for the inconvenience and double work this has caused. We are supposed to meet next week on Wednesday, but the database will not be restored by then. 

I will let you know once we have the AFRCDAR folder restored. 


p.s – Please join the ‘IMA/AGR_Purge’ group on Teams where we we’ve posted training and the Background Paper and chat!

Sir,

I just wanted to circle back on our talk this morning.

ARPC.CSS1@us.af.mil is having tons of cert issues. Sometimes we can open emails, sometimes we can’t. Sometimes some of the team can open certain email and sometimes others can,

We continuously have folks remove the certs and re-pull from the GAL but even for myself, when I delete and re-pull, the next day or two my emails can’t be opened. This is causing a huge work stoppage on our programs as this is our only method of assisting customers. 

Any assistance is greatly appreciated.


Thank you.

Good afternoon,

- This is the ticket submission for Tableau Desktop v2020.4 updates for the DPD users in the Cc line. 

Information was pushed from A1 this week that Tableau Desktop has released a new version (2020.4) that needs to be installed, as the current version (2020.3) will soon no longer be supported.  

If you are in this email you have been identified as having a Tableau Desktop license and require the updated version. 

The CSC has downloaded the newest version and has successfully updated Dr. Johson’s machine today with 2020.4. TSgt Buono (NCOIC) did mention they may be able to perform the updates remotely through VPN. If you get a notification of remote access, please save work and allow access. If updates over VPN do not work, you will have to drop your machines off at the CSC for updates. If this is the case, we will have to figure out an alternative for Maj Tischler.

Good afternoon,
 
We have a user(CC’d) that is having issues when trying to authenticate through the DISA Menlo Isolation Platform. We followed all the troubleshooting steps with no luck. When selecting his certificate it shows the correct authentication cert so that’s not the issue. We tried on different systems and on all web browsers. But he still gets the authentication failed. This is with all sites that have to go through that platform. He works in our mailroom so he needs to get to the UPS site to ship things. His DODID number is 1020324330 if you need it. Can we get some assistance on resolving this issue please.

Team DPAA,

Happy Thursday! It’s been a TOUGH week and I’m looking forward to all of us taking some time tomorrow afternoon to let loose a bit and recognize our hails and farewells! Please see below for activities, notes from staff meeting, and Division due outs…

Activities:
• Today’s IHT CANCELLED in lieu of…..
o ARPC Promotion Ceremony! Tomorrow 26 August @ 1400 in the Summit to celebrate TSgt Collins promotion to MSgt!!
o Please join us after the ceremony for a late lunch at BJs to celebrate the promotion at 1515. Please email SMSgt Strickler to RSVP! 
• DPAA Hails & Farewells Offsite Friday 27 August at Main Event 1230-1730 (64 Centennial Blvd Highlands Ranch, CO 80129) DPAA leadership is covering tickets so please email SMSgt Strickler if you CAN NOT attend. This is considered an alternate duty location; if unable to attend, you must be working or on leave
• Rising 6 Burger Burn this Friday on the patio

DPAA Notes:
• Leave
o September is going to be a busy time for us as we close out the Fiscal Year.  However, I think its also important that our member’s continue to take leave within reason.  I define it as a balance between ensuring the continued mission and the time-off that you so deservingly earned.  My intent is not to close out / cancel leave during this timeframe, but I ask for your understanding and that you work with your direct supervisors and your Branch Chiefs/Superintendents to make that determination. 

DUE OUTS:
• TELEWORK AGREEMENTS must be accomplished by 1 September. Please see attachment, complete, and save on the N Drive at the following location…. N:\DPAA New Sharedrive folder\TELEWORK AGREEMENTS (TSgt Williams will be reviewing the agreements so if he contacts you, please work with him on corrections)

DPA Staff Meeting Notes:
• Last week of DPAA on break room cleanup. Please ensure we are remaining diligent with clean up!
• Please ensure members are wearing masks at all times if not eating or drinking and everyone is cleaning/sanitizing their sections daily
• In need of DPA volunteers and one lead with assisting Ms. Willett for the ARPC Thanksgiving extravaganza! Email SMSgt Strickler if interested
• Fitness testing- outdoors only

COVID Updates:
• Buckley is posturing for HPCON Bravo+ effective 30 Aug
• With Pfizer vaccine being FDA approved, SECDEF is drafting the policy requiring mandated vaccines for military members
o Limited exemption options:
? Religious reasons (requires MAJCOM approval; difficult to obtain)
? Medical reasons (must be approved by a military doctor)
? Admin reason (separating or retiring in 100 days)
• Gym will be limited access for vaccinated guests only
• Teleworking-all members must be prepared for a recall to the building at any time. Child care should no longer be an issue or an excuse to not return to the building when required. If there is any reason why a member is unable to come to the building when required (ie, medical issues/humanitarian reason) please contact SMSgt Strickler immediately. Temporary issues such as illness or quarantine do not count towards this. 

To wrap this up SMSgt Strickler needs RSVPs for Main Event and BJs, volunteers for Thanksgiving feast, and any telework issues preventing immediate recalls to the building.  We look forward to Friday afternoon’s off-site to see everyone’s smiling faces, recognize our hails, properly send off our farewells and just to come out and have some fun!!

Thank you so much for your help in this matter. 

Sending these docs over per my conversation with Sgt Childs, Ms Alexander is our new civilian secretary replacing Ms. Penny Newman. We are requesting NIPR access for the member as she has came over from the ARMY and needs AF account access. Please let us know if you have any further questions. Thank you again!

Good Morning Sir/Ma’am, 

From what I’ve been told, we now have to submit a request to access the wifi within the building. 

Please let me know what all I need to do to submit the request. I usually have at least 1-2 virtual meetings a day via Zoom, and since I cannot access these meetings using my government laptop, I use my personal laptop to attend them. 

Thank you, in advance, for your assistance. 

Respectfully,

However, when I follow the prompts to log in it goes to a do you want to reset jabber and if you say yes, then it is an endless loop.  I never get past page 1 of the ARPC Jabber user guide.  I have entered my 16 digit DOD ID code and the password 12345.  I have entered the 12 digit DOD ID code and the password 12345.  I have even entered “password12345”.  All to the endless loop.

Team,

My Jabber does not allow me to go to “Advanced Settings” to forward my phone.  I have attached a screenshot of my Jabber.  Not sure if there’s a fix, or if it needs to be reinstalled, or if I’m doing something wrong.

Computer name is: ARTYL-3832VY

Per the email I attached, after remapping to your printer via \\arty-qs-001v it will display with a new name (ARTY-PTR-0**).  If you try to choose the old name to print with, it will not work.

The ""install a printer"" icon is currently not working for anyone, sir.  I'm not sure if you saw our emails from last week, but you'll need to copy and paste \\arty-qs-001v into File Explorer and this will take you to the new print server.  From there, you should be able to map to your printer.

Good Morning CSC Team!

I hope this email finds you well. We’ve requested ERAB folder access to the September Board member’s a few weeks ago. However, MSgt Wirth (DOD ID 1293297637) currently does not have access. I’ve also copy/pasted the other board member’s DOD ID below to verify they have been granted access. 

Reference No.: INC000027467982
Summary: O Drive access, private folder for Quarterly Board on Thursday, 09 Sep 2021

The O-Drive Path: 
1. DPT
2. DPTS
3. DPTS (Again)
4. Evaluations
5. ERAB Quarterly Board 

FYSA, I’ve attached the original email requesting ERAB Folder access.

Please let me know if you have any questions or need additional information. 

Very Respectfully,
SSgt Munoz

I am facilitating the Teams portion of the RPA Townhall led by Gen Johnson today at 1300 in the Summitt. I will need the Wifi info/password to connect online.

Also, the Eagle1d wifi that covers the Pikes Peak conference room is not working with the Dolphins1d password. Has it been changed?

Thank you!

All,

We are trying to decommission the VNX at all bases.  Please move your ISE servers (ARTY-ACS-003v and 004V) which are now residing on data stores ARTY-VNX-08 and ARTY-VNX-09 respectively to ARTY-X0924-008-XDPRS0-001-ISE which is under the ARTY-CISCO-ISE data store folder viewable in vCenter from the Datastore view.

Please remember these have to be taken down to migrate (choose change storage only).  Only do one at a time preferably after hours.  Please let us know when you have this completed so we can reclaim the VNX data stores.  Thank you.

Helpdesk – I am requesting wifi access in the ARPC building.  Justification – in my role of managing the ICF contractors we need to hold remote meetings via commercial Microsoft Teams since the contractors do not have access to AFNET. When I attempt to join from an AFNET connected computer, firewall rules prevent me from joining the commercial Teams instance.

There probably isn't an issue with your system sound then.  The issue more than likely lies with your sound settings within Teams.  You need to make sure the speaker settings match that of your system.  For example, my systems speakers are set to ""Speakers (High Definition Audio Device)"" so in teams, I'll need to make sure that setting is mirrored.  Please keep in mind, you can only set the sound settings when you're in a Teams meeting/call.  If you need more clarification, please give us a call at 3139 to avoid having to making a trip in.

Good afternoon Jorge,

I hope this finds you well and in great spirits.

I’m reaching out to you because they have you all listed as the POCs for Network Administrator on the ARPC Out-Processing Checklist. However, I called and was informed you all are not the POCs for this but was told you would know who is, so here I am hoping you can point me in the right direction as you are Yoda. LOL! My last day at ARPC will be 30 SEP 2021, so I want to ensure I get ahold of someone soon-ish.

If you need anything from me, please let me know.

Appreciate YOU!
Happy Wednesday!

The SOC is working on the expired website certificates which is why you are getting that error. You can bypass it if you use Firefox if you are trying to get to Cisco Finesse for example.

We've seen this fairly often when user's have too many applications/pages open while conducting the Teams meetings while in the building and teleworking.  I would recommend closing all other applications and minimizing those that need to stay up unless you're presenting to the meeting.

We sent several emails regarding this last week.  All printers have been migrated to a new print server - ARTY-QS-001V.  You'll need to open File Explorer and type in the path - \\arty-qs-001v - at the top of the page.  Once you do this, you should find your printer there to map to it.  If you're unable to map to your printer, you'll need to provide us with your system name (ARTYL-******) and the printer you need access to.

Can you confirm whether or not you have the latest SDC?  You can do this by typing in ""This PC"" in your task bar search function and then click ""properties.""  Once that page opens, your SDC version will be next to ""Model:""

My extension is 3235, name should show “Stefani Bradley”.

Please let me know if you need any additional information. 

Thank you for your time and have a great day.

I’ve had to submit multiple access requests to folders within the DS office drive folder.  Is there any way I can get blanket access so I don’t have to request access to multiple subfolders?

Morning Michelle!

This mailbox:  “ARPC/DPT All Distro” is another item to add to the checklist for in/out processing for all of our DPT folks. I would say don’t add the RPA-since they are temps and the FT should be passing information along. I will leave that up to you and how much labor you want to put into them.

It currently contains names that no longer work in DPT so when people use it, it is not reaching everyone. Please use your accurate employee listing to review it and make a listing of those needing add/removed and send to arpc.helpdesk@us.af.mil and they will instruct further. They may make you the owner and send the instructions to perform the add/removal actions yourself, I am not sure though. I have done it before for different mailboxes and it’s not hard, just a bunch of clicks to get to the right place.

Please let me know when you’re available to work on this, thanks so much ;-)    (Not a priority for right this moment, but would be nice to have done in the next couple of weeks as we get ready for a Director All-Call meeting)

Our NTP was pointing to a clock at AFRC that has since been removed. We also have our network devices currently pointing to 129.54.234.34 and 129.54.234.35. These are our DNS servers on our ADX suite.  This is what we get when we do a ""show ntp status"" on our core:

Clock is synchronized, stratum 5, reference is 129.54.234.35  
nominal freq is 250.0000 Hz, actual freq is 250.0173 Hz, precision is 2**22
ntp uptime is 211721700 (1/100 of seconds), resolution is 4000
reference time is E50844F9.1B630822 (15:53:29.106 UTC Wed Oct 6 2021)
clock offset is -27.4281 msec, root delay is 88.67 msec
root dispersion is 6460.81 msec, peer dispersion is 3.75 msec
loopfilter state is 'CTRL' (Normal Controlled Loop), drift is -0.000069383 s/s
system poll interval is 512, last update was 303 sec ago.

Our voip systems require stratum 2 or less. Is there another clock source that we can use for NTP and could you please check the DNS servers to see where they are receiving their timing from. If you could also let use know if that will suffice for our timing needs.",Denver ARPC

Good afternoon, 

DPTG is the primary OPR for the ARPC Commander’s Field Support (FSSE) line. We currently have a recorded message a caller hears when they dial (720) 847-3400 or DSN 847-3400. We want to add another recorded message in front of the current message with following verbiage:

Greetings, 

You have reached the Field Support Services Element. The purpose of this line is to assist General Officers, Commanders, Chiefs, and Executive Officers, to include FSS and CSS Superintendents, with benefit or pay affecting issues that must be resolved within 48 hours for assigned members. 

If you are General Officer, Commander, Chief or an FSS Superintendent calling with an urgent pay-effecting issue for a member within the scope of your supervision please press 1. If you are not an eligible caller, please contact the Total Force Service Center @1-800-525-0102 or submit a request via myPers @www.mypers.af.mil.

Thank you and have a nice day.

Goal - Upon pressing 1, the call routes to the current FSSE answering service or connects with live DPTG rep.  We would also like to explore the possibility that the call can automatically route to the TFSC SA 1-800 number if they dial 2. 

Please let me know if you need additional information or clarification or would to discuss in person. 

Thanks in advance,
